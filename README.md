# modRSW_EnKF
An idealised convective-scale forecast-assimilation framework

This repository aims to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and continued use of the software developed by TK and deposited in the git repository. It should contain sufficient instruction for users to implement and adapt the source code (briefly comprising Python scripts for the numerical solver, idealised forecast-assimilation routines, plotting and data analysis). 

CAVEAT: this is not a black-box model and should accordingly be used with care and curiosity!
