# modRSW_EnKF
## An idealised convective-scale forecast-assimilation framework

This repository aims to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and continued use of a basic convective-scale forecast -assimilation system developed during TK's PhD (Kent 2016). The forecast component comes from an idealised fluid model of convective-scale Numerical Weather Prediction (modRSW; Kent et al. 2017) and the assimilation algorithm is the perturbed-observation Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The following document should contain sufficient instruction for users to download, implement and adapt the source code, which briefly comprises Python scripts for the numerical solver, idealised forecast-assimilation routines, plotting and data analysis. 

***CAVEAT: this is not a black-box model and should accordingly be used with care and curiosity!***

How to get started with the source code and files is outlined below. A brief overview of each file is given and there are some model-only and forecast-assimilation test cases to check things are up and running properly.

For further details, including what should be modified in the scripts for different experimental set-ups, please see the pdf document (TO DO - if necessary?).

## Background
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) can be thought of as initial value problem comprising a forecast model and suitable initial conditions, with its accuracy depending critically on both. Data Assimilation (DA) attempts to provide the optimal initial conditions for the forecast model by estimating the state of the atmosphere and its uncertainty using a combination of forecast and observational information whilst taking into account their respective uncertainties. Optimality of the initial state is crucial in such a highly nonlinear system with limited predictability, and the forecast models need regular reinitialisation to prevent divergence from the true solution. 

In particular, DA techniques need to evolve in order to keep up with the developments in convection-permitting NWP models. To aid understanding of and facilitate research into highly complex forecast-assimilation systems, computationally inexpensive ‘idealised’ models can be employed that embody some essential features of these systems. Kent et al. (2017) have developed on such idealised fluid model that combines the nonlinearity of the rotating shallow water equations (SWEs) with switches for the initiation of convection and precipitation. It modifies the SWEs to include some simplified dynamics of cumulus convection, including rapid ascent and descent of air, and the transport of moisture.

Data assimilation research using idealised models is primarily carried out in a so–called 'twin' experiment setting, whereby the same computational model is used to generate a 'nature' run (which acts as a surrogate truth) and the forecasts. If the forecasts are generated using exactly the same model integration as the nature run, the resulting DA experiments are said to be carried out in a perfect model setting. On the other hand, in an imperfect model scenario, forecasts are generated using a different model configuration, e.g., with misspecified model parameters or at a coarser spatial resolution. The nature run is a single long integration of the numerical model and is a proxy for the true evolving physical system. It is the principal difference between idealised and operational DA experiments and its function is twofold. First, it is used to produce pseudo-observations of the physical system, which are then assimilated into the forecast model. These pseudo-observations (also known as synthetic observations) are generated by applying the observation operator to the state vector from the nature run and adding random samples from a specified observational error distribution. Second, it provides a verifying state with which to compare the forecast and analysis estimates and thus quantify the errors in each. 

One example of a potential configuration of the model and assimilation algorithm using this framework is detailed in chapter 6 of Kent (2016), and provides the basis for the source code available here.

## Test cases

### 1. Model only: integration and dynamics

Given a computational mesh, model parameters, and an initial condition, the model can be integrated to a specified finite time. The ```run_modRSW.py``` script achieves this, using functions from ```f_modRSW.py```, initial conditions from ```init_cond_modRSW.py``` and parameters from ```parameters.py```, plotting the model variables at given times.

The default model parameters are:

Name | Parameter      | Values
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Rossby | Ro  | Inf
Froude | Fr  | 1.1
Base height | H0  | 1.0
Threshold c | Hc  | 1.02
Threshold r | Hr  | 1.05
beta | beta | 0.2
alpha | alpha | 10
c2 | c2  | 0.1Hr/(Fr)^2

In  ```run_modRSW.py```, the user can specify the resolution ```Nk```, initial condition ```ic```, and the number of "hours" to integrate ```Nmeas```. The routine then integrates the initial condition from ```tn=0``` to ```tmax``` and saves figures of the plotted ```Nmeas``` solutions in the created directory  ```cwd/test_model```.

Default setting:

Name | Parameters    | Values
------------- | ------------- | -------------
No. of elements | Nk  | 200
Init. cond. | ic  | init_cond_topog_cos
No. of cycles | Nmeas  | 3

To run this from the terminal:
```
python run_modRSW.py
```

First, the initial condition is generated and a figure saved in  ```cwd/test_model```. Then the integration starts and figures and simulation data are saved in  ```cwd/test_model``` at the given times. This should be clear from the text that is printed to the terminal. When ```tmax``` is reached, the integration stops and a summary of the simulation is printed to the terminal. Just above the summary on the terminal, the maximum value of h(x) at time t=0.288 is given; verify that the same numerical value is obtained:
```
CHECK data value: maximum h(x) at t = 0.288: 1.70591737156
```

Also check the saved figures: go to the directory ```test_model``` and open the figures and compare with the figure below (```t2_Nk200```).

![t2_Nk200](figs/t2_Nk200.png)

In idealised forecast-assimilation experiments, it is typical to use a finer resolution to generate the nature run, constituting an 'imperfect' twin experiment (see Background above). To see the impact on the solution of integrating at a finer resolution, open the ```run_modRSW.py``` script and change the number of elements to ```Nk = 800```. After saving, run the script again:
```
python run_modRSW.py
```
This simulation will take longer since the smaller grid-length requires a smaller time step for stability. As before, verify that the same numerical value for the height variable is obtained:
```
CHECK data value: maximum h(x) at t = 0.288: 2.15336146511
```
Also check the saved figures, and compare with the figure below (```t2_Nk800```).

![t2_Nk800](figs/t2_Nk800.png)

Typically (and as done in the idealised DA experiments), simulation data is saved and subsequently used to generate plots in separate 'offline' plotting routines.  The routine ```plot_test_model.py``` shows how to load the saved data and plot multiple subplots. This also gives a better comparison between the two simulations. To run from the terminal:
```
python plot_test_model.py
```
This plots four figures (for the four times the data is saved) and saves them in the same directory ```test_model```. Verify that the following figure is produced (```t2_compare```): 

![t2_compare](figs/T2_compare.png)

In idealised DA experiments, the Nk=200 simulation represents the forecast and the Nk=800 simulation is the nature run. This figure shows an example trajectory of both forecast and nature at a given time: h (top), u (middle), and r (bottom) from the forecast model (left) and the nature run (right). The forecast trajectory is smoother and exhibits 'under-resolved' convection and precipitation while the nature run has sharper 'resolved' features and is a proxy for the truth. The thick black line in the top panels is the topography, the red dotted lines are the threshold heights. 

Conceptually, the basic data assimilation problem can be summarised using this figure: adjust the forecast (left) using pseudo-observations (generated by noisy samples of the nature run) in order to provide a better estimate of the nature run (right). 

### 2. Idealised forecast-assimilation experiments

#### Running an experiment

The main run program for idealised forecast-assimilation experiments is ```main_p.py```. Its workhorse is the subroutine function ```run_enkf()``` in the ```subr_enkf_modRSW_p```, which carries out each experiment, i.e., the ensemble forecasts and analysis steps for the given outer loop parameters. The combination of outer loop parameters define a single experiment. 

The default model parameters are (see ```parameters.py```):

Name | Parameter      | Values
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Rossby | Ro  | Inf
Froude | Fr  | 1.1
Base height | H0  | 1.0
Threshold c | Hc  | 1.02
Threshold r | Hr  | 1.05
beta | beta | 0.2
alpha | alpha | 10
c2 | c2  | 0.1Hr/(Fr)^2

The default parameters for this test assimilation are:

Name | Parameter      | Values
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Mesh refinement factor | dres  | 4
Ensemble size | n_ens  | 20
No. of cycles | Nmeas  | 3

The outer loop parameters are specified in ```main_p.py```:

Name | Parameter      | Values
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Localisation scale | loc  | 1e-10
Add. inflation | add_inf  | 0.2
Mult. inflation | inf  | [1.01, 1.05, 1.1]

The purpose of this test case is to check that the cycled system is up and running, including the saving of data and readmes to automatically-generated directories. Once this has been verified, the outer loop and assimilation parameters can be extended (e.g., more combinations in the table above, longer runs with, e.g., ```Nmeas = 48``` ). 

First, the nature run is generated and saved as this is the same for all experiments. If it already exists, it is loaded instead. Once this is complete, the routine enters the EnKF outer loop.

To run from the terminal:
```
python main_p.py
```
Text is printed to the terminal throughout to provide information and updates on its progress. After looping through all parameter combinations, a brief summary is printed to the terminal and the program ends. 
To check the saved data and readmes, enter the relevant directory:
```
cd test_enkf
```
Here, there should be 2 data files for the nature run, ```U_tr_array.npy``` and ```B_tr.npy```, and more subdirectories for each experiment. The subdirectories are suffixed with digits ```ijk``` denoting each experiment, e.g., ```test_enkf111``` refers to experiment ```[loc, add_inf, inf] = [1e-10, 0.2, 1.01]```. Each subdirectory has data saved from this particular experiment and a ```readme.txt``` summarising this experiment. Check:

```
cd test_enkf111
more readme.txt
```

Now the data has been saved, we can move on to plotting and data analysis...
